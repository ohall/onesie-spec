## What are we doing?

1. Building an open source React and/or React Native client for OneOps allowing users to easily view the most useful information for relevant assemblies.
2. Building open source modules for easily interacting with the OneOps API.
3. Spinning up an installation (and potentially a meaningful fork) of OneOps for development and reasearch purposes.

## Why are we doing this?

1. To build expertise in new client side technology and gain exposure to the latest tools and best practices.
2. To raise the profile of GRT in the open source community, by building a portfolio of useful modules.
3. To consolidate and expand our advantage in knowledge of OneOps so we can: 
	a. Better capitalize on any success OneOps has in the larger community.
	b. Provide additional engineers trained in OneOps to WalmartLabs.


## How are we getting started?

1. Get a general familiarity with React dev concepts and tools.
2. Create a rough wireframe of our React client.
3. Describe some API modules we'll want in order to interact with OneOps.
4. Collect/Create training material on OneOps.
5. Get the team together and discuss technical details.
